# StackDock

**Open Source Multi-Cloud Management Platform**

Manage websites, apps, databases, servers, and APM tools across multiple providers from a unified interface.

![StackDock Logo](https://github.com/stackdock/stackdock/blob/main/docs/stackdock-logo-dark-mode.svg?raw=true)

## The Vision

**Remember how shadcn/ui changed UI development?**

```bash
npx shadcn add button
# → Copies component into YOUR codebase
# → You own the code
# → No vendor lock-in
```

**StackDock does the same for infrastructure.**

```bash
npx stackdock add gridpane
# → Copies infrastructure adapter into YOUR codebase
# → You own the dock adapter
# → Customize, fork, publish your own
```

### Why This Matters

- **WordPress democratized content management**
- **StackDock democratizes infrastructure management**
- **True FOSS**: You own the code (docks, UI, everything)
- **Composable**: Build your perfect control plane
- **Extensible**: If it has an API, it can be a dock

## Welcome Aboard Captain! ⚓️

You're early – but welcome to the shipyard! The blueprints are evolving, the vision is locked in, and we're building in public.

**This isn't just another tool.** It's infrastructure's WordPress moment.

Star the repo to watch the build! ⭐

## ⚠️ PRE-ALPHA WARNING ⚠️

**This is pre-alpha software. NOT ready for production.**

- Breaking changes frequent
- Core features under development
- Database schema evolving
- DO NOT use with critical infrastructure

**For early contributors only.** Star for updates on stable releases.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 18+, npm 9+

```bash
# Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/stackdock/stackdock.git
cd stackdock
npm install

# Setup environment
node scripts/generate-encryption-key.js
# Create apps/web/.env.local with your Convex + Clerk values
# Paste the generated ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY into apps/web/.env.local

# Start Convex (terminal 1)
npm run dev:convex

# Start app (terminal 2)
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

**Open http://localhost:3000**

You should see:
- Landing page with StackDock branding
- **Green "Connected" status** if Convex is configured correctly
- Connection status indicator shows: "Connected • Convex is connected!"

## Current Status

- ✅ **TanStack Start** - Fully configured with file-based routing
- ✅ **Convex** - Connected and working (test query available)
- ✅ **Clerk** - Authentication integrated and working
- ✅ **User Sync** - Auto-syncs users from Clerk to Convex
- ⏳ **Dock Adapters** - Ready to build once encryption is added
